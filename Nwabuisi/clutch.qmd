title: "Clutch Score: Measuring High‑Pressure Finishing"
format: revealjs
---

## Motivation

- Major tournaments like the Women’s World Cup are short (6–7 matches per team).
- Top‑scorer rankings often tie multiple players on identical goal tallies.
- **Goal:** Create a _Clutch Score_ to differentiate players by their performance in high‑impact moments.

---

## Key Shot Contexts

1. **Late‑Game Finishes** (minute ≥ 80 of regulation)  
2. **Under‑Pressure** (`Shooter was under defensive pressure`)  
3. **Instant (One‑Touch)** (`Duration of Shot < 0.3s`)  
4. **High‑Quality Chances** (`Distance To Goal ≤ 12m`)  
5. **Elimination‑Stage** (extra time periods)

---

## Per‑Context Conversion Rates

For each context $C$ mentioned on the last page:

$$
\mathrm{rate}_C = \frac{\#\{\text{goals in }C\}}{\#\{\text{shots in }C\}}.
$$

\# here means "number of"\
If a player has zero attempts in $C$, define $\mathrm{rate}_C = 0$.

---

## Normalization to [0,1]

Each context rate is rescaled across the Top‑15 goalscorers group:

$$
\mathrm{norm}_C = \frac{\mathrm{rate}_C - \min(\mathrm{rate}_C)}{\max(\mathrm{rate}_C) - \min(\mathrm{rate}_C)},
$$

with all equal values mapping to 0.

---

## Composite Clutch Score

Average the five normalized rates:

$$
\mathrm{Clutch\ Score} = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{C \in \{\mathrm{late, press, instant, quality, elim}\}} \mathrm{norm}_C.
$$

Ranges from 0 (never clutch) to 1 (always clutch).

## Example Calculation

```{r clutch-plot, echo=FALSE}

## Interpretation & Application

- **Volume vs. Clutch:** Separates bulk scorers from big‑moment performers.  
- **Talent Management:** Guides lineup and substitution decisions.  
- **Training Focus:** Identifies skill gaps (e.g., late‑game composure, pressure handling).

---

## Beyond the Data

- I hoped Clutch Score would reflect a player’s mental fortitude carrying beyond the World Cup.
- **Real-world challenges:**
  - Injuries sidelined some stars for entire seasons.
  - Personal life events (e.g., maternity leave) interrupted careers.
- These factors show **limitations** in a very statistical clutch metric.

---

## Beyond the Data
- Future enhancements could incorporate:
  - Longitudinal fitness and availability data.
  - Psychological or workload indicators.
  - Training and recovery metrics.
